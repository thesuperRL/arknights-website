# Arknights Tier Lists & Team Builder — User Guide

This guide explains how to use the website: browsing operator tier lists, synergies, building teams, and managing your operator collection.

---

## Getting started

### Creating an account

1. Click **Register** in the navigation bar.
2. Enter your **email** and choose a **password** (at least 8 characters).
3. Confirm your password and submit.
4. You’ll be taken to your **Profile** page.

You need an account to use the **Team Builder**, **Integrated Strategies**, and to track which operators you own.

### Logging in

- Use **Login** in the nav bar and enter your email and password.
- If you’re already logged in, the nav shows **Team Builder**, **Integrated Strategies**, and your **nickname** (or email) instead of Login/Register.

---

## Navigation

The top bar includes:

- **Home** — Overview and link to Team Builder or sign-up.
- **Tier Lists** — All niche/tier lists (e.g. DPS, laneholders, healing).
- **Synergies** — Operator synergies (e.g. burn, necrosis).
- **All Operators** — Full operator roster with search and filters.
- **Team Builder** / **Integrated Strategies** / **Profile** — Only when logged in.
- **Login** / **Register** or **Logout** — Depending on auth state.

The **footer** has a **language selector** (operator name language) and a **Feedback** link.

---

## Tier lists (niche lists)

### Browsing tier lists

1. Go to **Tier Lists**.
2. You’ll see cards for each **niche** (e.g. “Early Laneholder”, “Attack Debuffing”).
3. Click a card to open that **niche list**.
4. Each list shows operators by **rating** (SS, S, A, B, C, D, F), then by rarity and name.

### How operators are shown

- **Peak-only:** Each operator appears **once** in a list, at their **best** form:
  - **Module** (if they have a module in that niche) > **E2** > **base**.
- So you always see “at peak” rankings; there are no duplicate rows for the same operator at different promotions.

### Level badges (E2 / module)

- By default, **level badges** (E2 or module icons on operator cards) are **hidden**.
- To see which promotion level the ranking assumes, turn on **“Show level badges (E2 / module)”** at the top of the niche list page.
- The overlay shows a small E2 or module icon on the operator portrait when that level is required for the listed tier.

### Other details

- **Related Niches** — If the list has related niches, you can jump to them from the same page.
- **Owned operators** — If you’re logged in, operators you’ve marked as owned on your profile are visually distinct (e.g. not grayed out) so you can see what you have for that niche.

### Special lists (from Tier Lists page)

- **Trash Operators** — Operators with no optimal use.
- **Free Operators** — Operators that are free to obtain.
- **Global Range Operators** — Operators with global range.
- **Unconventional Niches** — Operators that fill unusual roles.
- **Good Low-Rarity Operators** — Strong low-rarity options.

These work like other niche lists; they’re just grouped as “special” on the Tier Lists page.

## Synergies

### What synergies are

Synergies describe **themed teams or playstyles** (e.g. “Burn”, “Necrosis”, “Offensive Recovery”). Each synergy has:

- **Core** operators (often required or central).
- **Optional** operators that fit the theme.

### Browsing synergies

1. Go to **Synergies**.
2. Click a synergy to open its page.
3. You’ll see **Core** and **Optional** groups; each group lists operators (with class, rarity, etc.).

### Level badges on synergies

- As on tier lists, level badges are **off by default**.
- Use **“Show level badges (E2 / module)”** at the top of the synergy page to show E2/module overlays on operator cards.

---

## All Operators

- **All Operators** shows the full roster.
- Use **search** and **filters** (rarity, class) to narrow the list.
- Click an operator to open their **Operator** page.

---

## Operator page

From **All Operators**, a tier list, or a synergy, click an operator to open their detail page.

You’ll see:

- **Profile** — Portrait, name, rarity, class, global availability.
- **Niches** — Every niche list that includes this operator, with:
  - **Tier** (e.g. A, S) for that niche.
  - **Level** (E2 / module) only if you turn on **“Show level badges (E2 / module)”** in the Niches section.
- **Synergies** — Synergies they’re part of and their role (core/optional) and groups.

Rankings and synergies use the same **peak-only** logic: one best tier/level per niche (module > E2 > base).

---

## Your profile (logged-in only)

- Open **Profile** from the nav (your nickname/email).
- **Owned operators** — Add or remove operators you’ve raised. The Team Builder and Integrated Strategies use this list.
- **Want to use** — Mark operators you prefer to use; the builders can favor these when suggesting teams.
- You can search and filter (rarity, class) when adding or viewing operators.

---

## Team Builder (logged-in only)

- **Team Builder** builds a **12-operator team** from your **owned** operators.
- You set:
  - **Required niches** — Roles you must cover (e.g. healing, arts DPS).
  - **Preferred niches** — Optional roles you’d like.
  - Other options (e.g. rarity preferences, “want to use”).
- The tool suggests a team that fits your constraints and favors higher-tier operators in each niche (at peak: module > E2 > base).
- You can lock slots, swap operators, and re-run to refine the team.

---

## Integrated Strategies (logged-in only)

- **Integrated Strategies** is for building teams for the Integrated Strategies (roguelike) mode.
- It uses your **owned** operators and similar preference/niche logic to the main Team Builder, but tuned for IS (e.g. recruitment, temp recruits).
- Use it to plan or adjust your IS roster and see which niches are covered.

---

## Language (operator names)

- In the **footer**, use the **language selector** to switch operator name language (e.g. EN, CN, TW, JP, KR) where supported.
- This affects operator names across the site (tier lists, synergies, All Operators, profile, etc.).

## Tips

- **Peak-only:** Everywhere we rank operators at their **peak** (module > E2 > base). You see one row per operator per list at their best form.
- **Level badges:** Turn on “Show level badges” when you want to see whether a ranking is for E2 or a specific module.
- **Profile first:** For Team Builder and IS, add your raised operators in **Profile** so recommendations match what you actually have.
- **Want to use:** Mark favorites in Profile so the builders can prefer them when filling teams.

If something doesn’t work as expected, use the **Feedback** link in the footer to report it.
